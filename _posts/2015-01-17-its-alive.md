There comes a time in every person's life where they should start writing interesting tutorials and guides, rather than strictly consuming them. This blog is that effort.

Welcome to the coding couch, where you will find all musings on code and everything else technical.

I will be covering a lot of DevOps and Web Development things initially, including:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)
* [Go Web Development](https://golang.org)
* Node.js and IO.js Niceties
* Cloud Administration (AWS and Digital Ocean)
* Fun code projects you can do in a weekend
* How not to suck at life

Take a break, relax a bit, and enjoy!
